<blockquote>
  <p>Lumail is a modern console-based email client developed for GNU/Linux, supporting operations upon local Maildir hierarchies and remote IMAP mail-servers.</p>
  <p>There are many graphical clients for email, but comparatively few designed solely for console use.  With the exception of GNU Emacs none of the console clients I examined had any built in support for scripting with a <i>real</i> language.</p>
  <p>Lumail has differences from existing projects such as <tt>mutt</tt>, <tt>notmuch</tt> and similar alternatives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is a modal-client so you're always in one particular mode:
      <ul>
        <li>maildir-mode: Shows you the list of folders.</li>
        <li>index-mode: Shows you the list of messages.</li>
        <li>message-mode: Shows you a single message.</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Scripting is supported with a mature language.
      <ul>
        <li>Lumail, as the name might suggest, uses <a href="http://www.lua.org/">lua</a>.</li>
        <li>The <a href="/api/">Lua API</a> we present is simple, reliable, and self-consistent.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul>
