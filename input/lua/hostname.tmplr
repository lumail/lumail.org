version: 0.23
----

<p>This function will attempt to return the name of the current host.</p>
<p>This is a useful function if you're aiming to write configuration files that are portable across a number of hosts, and which need to have conditional handling.</p>
<p>Simple usage would be:</p>
<pre>
<a href="/lua/msg.html">msg</a>(hostname());
</pre>
