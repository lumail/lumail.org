----

<p>When you're composing an email via <a href="/lua/compose.html">compose()</a>, or <a href="/lua/reply.html">reply()</a>, your preferred editor will be invoked for you to enter your message text.</p>
<p>Immediately after the editor has terminated the function <span class="tt">on_edit_message()</span> will be invoked with the path to the recently-edited message.</p>
<p>This allows you the opportunity to update the message with a GPG-signature, invoke a spell-check, or similar.</p>
