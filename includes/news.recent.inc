  <dd><p>Version 2.9 of Lumail is now available upon our <a href="/download/">download page</a>.</p>
    <p>This release introduces the ability to sort message-lists by threads, and display them appropriately.

  <dd><p>Version 2.8 of Lumail is now available upon our <a href="/download/">download page</a>.</p>
    <p>This release improves the correctness of allocating C++ objects, which are accessible to Lua, as well as offering support for binding functions to multiple-keypresses.  (For example you can bind the string "111" to jump to line 111 of the current folder; this is done by default, to provide a mutt-like "jump" function.)</p>
